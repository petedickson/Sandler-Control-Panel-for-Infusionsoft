This is a basic Ruby wrapper for Rails I have written for the Infusionsoft API.  Right now, it is pretty basic but will work :)  I have plans to add more features, but for now this should suffice.

h2. Installation
* Run @ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/nateleavitt/api_infusionsoft.git@
* Create an initializer called api_infusionsoft.rb in config/initializers
* Include this code in the initializer @ApiInfusionsoft.set_account_apiconn("YOUR_APP.infusionsoft.com", "YOUR_API_KEY")@
* Put this code @include ApiInfusionsoft@ in any object that you want to have access to the API calls

From there you should be good to go.
